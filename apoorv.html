      <p>A very happy 21st birthday Laas. We grew up so fast. Weâ€™ve come a very long way since our empire in 8th grade lol. Even though we donâ€™t talk often like we used to before college began, i can safely say that no matter what youâ€™ve always got my back, and Iâ€™ve got yours too. Its honestly great to be able to call once in a while and get updates on each others lives and maybe goss here and there haha. Youâ€™ve accomplished wayy too much already for a college kid lmao and i know for a fact that your galore of accolades is yet to welcome its very best. Congratulations on Mika Singh go to Ahmedabad and become sugar addict. A very happy 21st once again lady, gimme treat when back</p>
