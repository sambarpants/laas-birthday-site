        <p>Happy birthday laasyalu
Itâ€™s been a journey from being dumb and 9 to less dumb and 21. Can you believe weâ€™ve been friends for more than a decade?
My mom always said that the people you meet in life could be your branches or roots. Roots are permanently a part of your life. They are the foundation of who you are and are the reason you stand up strong and hold your ground. You Laas, are my root.
Thank you for being my best friend, my strength and my constant support system. You are my home bbg. (And also like where i get half my personality from probably)  </p>
        <p>On another note, I am so so proud of you laas. And I'm proud of the person you've become. I'm glad to have been part of your life to see you become more confident and step out of your comfort zone. I am in constant awe of you and in some ways I also look up to you. Now you will either say "aboo" or become all emotional. But either ways, I want you to know that I love and admire you and I wish you can see the way I talk about you when someone asks me about you.</p>
        <p>You beautiful sweet child I miss you with all my heart. I wish we were 14 with no complains and spending all day together. I know we talk lesser and share less frequently and I want to change and I hope you know that there is no amount of distance that could lessen the love I have for you.
</p>
        <p>I love you so much. 
Canâ€™t wait to be drunk and making questionable decisionsÂ withÂ you. Welcome to the 21 club bestie, Here is to adulting together and debriefing over wine every week (Let me hope and believe)

Happy Birthday again bangaram <3</p>
