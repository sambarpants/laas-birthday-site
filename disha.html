      <p>Hello again my Knight :)</p>
      <p>For the first time Iâ€™m glad you donâ€™t live close to me because that means I get to make my first cheesy website card for you. Our love for you is now immortal on the internet. </p>
      <p>The last few months more than ever I randomly miss you so much, I know I havenâ€™t called so you have no idea this happened but I do. When we moved into our new house a part of me was a little sad that you werenâ€™t here and ever since Iâ€™ve dying for you to come live with us so please make it happen this year.</p>
      <p>I know everyone has been saying this but Iâ€™m so insanely proud of everything that youâ€™ve been doing in the past few years and that itâ€™s paid off now. Youâ€™ve been and I mean this genuinely, such an inspiration. I want to be as independent and driven as you have turned out to be and I want to do as much as you do. My girl plays sports and is financially independent and is an academic weapon and she dances and she sings and she plays and sheâ€™s gorgeous, people will think Iâ€™m making you up.</p>
      <p>No matter how long weâ€™re away for and no matter how many more comfort people I find, you will always be one of the first people Iâ€™ve opened up to and thinking about how I pure our friendship is makes my heart so full. Weâ€™re barely similar and we have no reason to have the bond we do except that we happened to be in the same section and Iâ€™m so grateful everything turned out the way it did. </p>
      <p>I love you so much and I really really miss you. Please send your hugs I need them. Also come home please Iâ€™ll make cookies for you or whatever it takes to bribe you. Okay bye muah </p>
      <p>P.S.- if i feel like it i'll keep editing this so i think you should revisit this website often</p>
